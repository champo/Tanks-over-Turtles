Tanks over Turtles is a game in which you have a given number of tanks over a circular world held by giant turtles.
Each of your tanks runs the same strategy without knowledge of the other tanks.
The tanks can move, ask for information of the map or shoot a missile. When a tank is reached by a missile, it instantly disappears from the map. The last remaining team on the map is the winner.

The initial information you will get, is the following line:

MAP_SIZE TEAM_ID SHOOT_RANGE NUMBER_OF_TANKS

  where MAP_SIZE is the length of the map, TEAM_ID is a positive integer representing your team, SHOOT_RANGE is the maximum distance the missiles reach, and NUMBER_OF_TANKS is the amount of tanks that your team controls.

When the rest of the players have joined the server you will receive a list of coordinates X, Y with the initial coordinates of your tanks. 

After this line, the server will query you for the command to execute for each tank, with this sintaxis:

QUERY N, M, ...

  where N, M, ... are the numbers of the tanks asked to make an action.

The operations (in order of priority of execution) available for the client when queried for a command are:

N MOVE [UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT]

  tank N moves one unit. The server will answer OK or DEAD if your tank got killed becaus of stepping into another tank.

N SHOOT [UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT]

  tank N shoots a missile. The server will answer OK, always, and you will not get information on whether your shooting killed another tank.

N LASER [UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT]

  tank N shoots a laser to know what is that exists to a side of the tank. It returns two integers separated by a space, the TEAM_ID of the tank in the specified direction, and the distance to it (remember the map is circular, so there always is a tank in front of you).

Every command has to end with a POSIX end of line ('\n').

The end of the round is marked by a message from the server saying:

END OF ROUND.

The end of the game is signaled by the server with the line:

END OF GAME. [DRAW|WINNER: N]

Where N is the winning team, in case there was one.
