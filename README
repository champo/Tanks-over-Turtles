Tanks over Turtles is a game in wich you have a given number of tanks over a circular world held by gigant turtles.
Each of your tanks runs the same strategy without knoledge of the other tanks.
The tanks can move, ask for information of the map or shoot a missile. When a tank is reached by a missile, it instantly disappears from the map. The last remaining team on the map is the winner.

The initiall call to your strategy programm is:

$ your_programm TEAM_ID SHOOT_RANGE

  * TEAM_ID is a positive integer representing your team
  * SHOOT_RANGE is the maximum distance the missiles reach

And during the gameplay, the operations (in order of appliance) available are:

MOVE [UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT]

  moves the tank one unit

SHOOT [UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT]

  shoots a missile

LASER [UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT]

  it returns two integers separated by a space, the TEAM_ID of the tank in the specified direction, and the distance to it (remember the map is circular, so there always is a tank in front of you).
